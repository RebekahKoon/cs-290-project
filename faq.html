          <h2>What Are Your Hours?</h2>
          <p>
            Our grooming salon is open Monday through Thursday 9am - 5pm, Friday 9am - 2pm, and
            Saturday and Sunday 9am - 12pm.
          </p>

          <h2>How Long Will it Take to Groom My Pet?</h2>
          <p>
            The time needed to groom your pet varies depending on the size of your dog and the type
            of your appointment. A bath will take approximately one hour, a bath and grooming will
            take about an hour and a half, and a bath, grooming, and styled cut appointment will
            take up to two hours.
          </p>

          <h2>What Type of Shampoo is Used?</h2>
          <p>
            We use <a href="https://earthbath.com/" target="_blank">Earthbath shampoo</a> when
            bathing your dog. This is a high-quality, all-natural oatmeal and aloe shampoo that is
            often used for dogs with sensitive skin. If your dog has any allergies to this shampoo,
            please let us know so that we can use an alternative shampoo.
          </p>

          <h2>What Dog Breeds Can You Groom?</h2>
          <p>
            We are experienced in grooming several different types of dogs. Please let us know what
            breed your dog is and we can groom your pet accordingly!
          </p>

          <h2>How Often Should I Groom My Dog?</h2>
          <p>
            This often depends on the breed of your dog. Long-haired dogs typically need to be
            bathed and groomed approximately every 1 to 2 months, whereas short-haired dogs can go
            about 3 months without being groomed. However, dogs should be brushed at least once per
            week, regardless of their breed. More information can be found

          <h2>Can You Groom My Cat?</h2>
          <p>
            Although we primarily groom dogs, we are also able to groom cats. Grooming for cats
            includes brushing their fur, clipping their nails, and cleaning their ears. However, we
            are unable to give your cat a bath. Please be aware that your cat will likely be around
            dogs while being groomed.
